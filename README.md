# Animation Tutorial - Meetup - Sept 12, 2015

##  Intro
In this meetup we learned all about CSS animations.  

We learned:

1. The design theory of using animations

2. How to use the `transition` CSS attribute to smooth animations between different states.

3.  How to use the `transform` CSS attribute to manipulate an element by either rotating, skewing, translating (moving), and/or scaling.

4. How to use keyframes to roll your own animations.

5. And how to chain all these together to create a fun and engaging site.
